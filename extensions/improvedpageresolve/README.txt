
Improved Page Resolve
------------------------------------

Version: 1.0
Author: Marcin Konicki (http://ahwayakchih.neoni.net)
Build Date: 2 March 2009
Requirements: Symphony version 2.0.1 or later.

[SYNOPSIS]

Improved Page Resolve allows you to create index page with parameters and 
show it without a need to include its path in URL. For example:

http://www.example.com/param_1_value/param_2_value

will work the same way as:

http://www.example.com/index_page/param_1_value/param_2_value

Unless there is a page with path the same as param_1_value, in which case 
that page will be shown.


[INSTALLATION]

1. Upload the 'improvedpageresolve' folder in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it on System > Extensions page: select the "Improved Page Resolve",
   choose Enable from the "With selected..." menu, then click "Apply" button.
